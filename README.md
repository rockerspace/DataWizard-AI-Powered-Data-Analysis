# DataWizard-AI-Powered-Data-Analysis
The challenge In today's data-driven world, valuable insights are locked away in spreadsheets and datasets that most professionals don't have the technical skills to analyze. Business owners, managers, and domain experts know their data is valuable but lack the programming knowledge to extract meaningful insights.

Build a collection of LangChain tools that perform basic data science tasks:

Listing available datasets
Loading and analyzing CSV files
Generating dataset summaries and statistics
Training and evaluating machine learning models
Document each tool's purpose and output format clearly to ensure the AI agent can use them effectively

Demonstrate why regular conversational agents have limitations when working with structured data

Implement an executor agent that can manage a multi-step workflow for data analysis

Create specialized LangChain tools: Develop custom tools for performing key data science tasks like dataset discovery, analysis, and modeling.
Implement efficient caching mechanisms: Build a system that stores and manages datasets in memory to optimize performance across multiple queries.
Design a natural language interface: Connect a language model to your tools, enabling conversational access to data science capabilities.
Develop context-aware agents: Create an executor agent that can maintain state and execute multi-step data analysis workflows.
Handle errors gracefully: Implement robust error handling for file operations and data processing tasks.
Test your assistant with real queries: Evaluate the system with practical business questions that demonstrate its ability to make data science accessible
